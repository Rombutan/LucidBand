# LucidBand! - The really thin, no-charge smartwatch.
## Philosophy
I quite like the idea of having lots of easily accessible data about myself. Fitness and biological data can be a big help in organizing and optimizing one's life, and I think everyone should have access to that data about *themselves*. 
Current smartwatches rely on a bluetooth connection for almost all of their functionality. I think that's a big flaw. To me, the whole point of a wearable is going where your phone can't.

## Technology
LucidBand has solar cells and tiny batteries and the processor in the wristband!
The only thing in the face is the display - everything else is on a flexible pcb built into the wristband. This lets the face be really thin - hopefully around 7mm - and also allows operation without the display (think: ankle band).
The band will be cast out of a semi-flexible clear epoxy or something.
