# LucidBand! - The really thin, no-charge smartwatch.
## Philosophy
I quite like the idea of having lots of easily accessible data about myself. Fitness and biological data can be a big help in organizing and optimizing one's life, and I think everyone should have access to that data about *themselves*. 
I want something really thin and somewhat modular that can collect a lot of the data I want to have access to.

## Technology
LucidBand hasa flexible solar cell and everything but the display in the wristband!
The only thing in the face is the display - everything else is on a pcb built into the bottom of the wristband (under your wrist). This lets the face be really thin - hopefully around 7mm - and also allows operation without the display (think: ankle band).
The band will be cast out of a semi-flexible clear epoxy or something.
